# project1
-----------------------------Sasquatch the Game --------------------------------------------
This is a simple game that involves the player to click the start button and watch to
see what happens with the roaming bigfoot picture.


This project1 was designed primarily using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This was my first attempt at 
designing a fully functional game based on a solid algorithm.
